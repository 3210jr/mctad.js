### <a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About

__mctad.js__ is a JavaScript library for probability and statistics. It was created to provide functionality missing from other such libraries — such as having an awareness of many common discrete and continuous probability distributions, and the ability to generate random variables from those distributions — although it also provides a growing list of standard descriptive statistics and statistical analyses.

### <a name="descriptive-statistics" class="anchor" href="#descriptive-statistics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Descriptive Statistics

Given an _Array of data_, __mctad.js__ can calculate its

* `arithmetic_mean(Array)`, aliased as `mean(Array)`
* `geometric_mean(Array)`
* `median(Array)`
* `mode(Array)`, always returned as an Array, if defined
* `sample_variance(Array)`
* `sample_standard_deviation(Array)`

There are also public methods for `sum` and `product`.

{% highlight javascript %}
> data = [1, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 12, 12, 12, 12, 17];
  [1, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 12, 12, 12, 12, 17]
> mctad.sum(data);
  107
> mctad.mean(data);
  8.23076923076923
> mctad.median(data);
  7
> mctad.mode(data);
  [6, 12]
{% endhighlight %}

When defined and non-trivial to implement, descriptive statistics are returned with any [probability distribution objects](#probability-distributions) you create.

### <a name="core_and_helpers" class="anchor" href="#core_and_helpers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Core and Helpers

__mctad.js__ has a number of methods, included in `/src/core`. __mctad.js__ uses them internally, but they are available for your use, and include

* `isInteger()`
* `allPositive(Array)`
* `sortNumeric(Array)`
* `toRadians(v)`
* `getBaseLog(x, y)`
* `getRandomArbitrary(min, max)`
* `getRandomInt(min, max)`
* `factorial(n)`
* `doubleFactorial(n)`
* `combination(n, k)`
* `Γ(n)`, aliased as `gamma(n)`

Documentation for these is interspersed with the code, meaning the [Groc-generated documentation](doc) is the best place to see how they're implemented and to learn what they do.

### <a name="probability-distributions" class="anchor" href="#probability-distributions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Probability Distributions

__mctad.js__ can create many common discrete and continuous probability distributions from parameters you supply. The resulting probability distribution objects contain common statistics on the distribution (when defined); convenience methods for accessing probability distribution, probability mass, and cumulative probability functions; domain & range helpers to simplify integration with [D3](http://d3js.org/), and random variable generators.

* Discrete Probability Distributions
  * [Discrete Uniform](discrete/uniform/)
  * [Bernoulli](discrete/bernoulli/)
  * [Binomial](discrete/binomial/)
  * [Geometric](discrete/geometric/)
  * [Hypergeometric](discrete/hypergeometric/)
  * [Pascal](discrete/pascal/)
  * [Poisson](discrete/poisson/)

* Continuous Probability Distributions
  * [Uniform](continuous/uniform/)
  * [Triangular](continuous/triangular/)
  * [Exponential](continuous/exponential/)
  * [Weibull](continuous/weibull/)
  * [Normal](continuous/normal/)
  * [Lognormal](continuous/lognormal/)
  * [Student's t](continuous/students_t/)
