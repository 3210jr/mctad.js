## Confidence Intervals

### Large-Sample Confidence Intervals on the Population Mean

If `data` is an array containing a large (_n_ > 30) number of random samples from a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ, so that the sample mean X̄ is approximately normal, then a level 100(1 - α) confidence interval for μ is

X̄ ±z<sub>α/2</sub>σ<sub>X̄</sub>
